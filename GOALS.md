# Product Goals — Easy Free Tokens

Status: **Implementation progress record**. Vision and killed bets were accepted
2026-09-18; subsequent goal-chain acceptance and completion evidence are recorded
in the entries below. G1–G41 are complete; the maintenance follow-up is recorded
separately below.

Vision (locked): **easy free token setup that just works — free-only scope.**
Anything that manages, meters, or optimizes paid spend is out. Anything that
removes setup steps or failure modes is in.

## How to run this file

- Exactly one goal is `active` at a time. Work it until every `Done when`
  item is verified with evidence, then update its status to `done`.
- **Chaining rule:** when a goal completes, immediately create the next goal
  as the active session goal in the same turn. Never end a turn with no
  active goal while goals remain below.
- **Audit rule:** a goal completes only when every `Done when` checkbox is
  checked with cited evidence (command output, test results, links). Partial
  progress never counts as completion.
- Commit and push per completed goal. Keep this file's statuses current.

## Maintenance follow-up — 2026-09-29

Completed the remaining Aion/ModelScope retirement cleanup in setup guidance,
environment examples, Compose and the landing page. Their existing tombstones
remain authoritative: replaying old credentials, provider objects and cached
free discovery rows produced no retired routes; registry reintroduction fails.

Restored the trusted public baseline from workflow run `36122700555`: migration
removed five retired records and omitted three obsolete finding links while
preserving active findings, hashes, fingerprints, revision and freshness.
An isolated live public maintenance refresh then produced a validated report.

Public status now refreshes discovery and unchanged evidence in temporary
state, commits the page/history/sitemap together, and reports skipped probes
separately. OVH's metadata-free `nvr-tts-*` entries are speech, preventing false
chat failures. Live checks observed two successes, one upstream OVH HTTP 429
and one OpenCode evidence skip. Eight changed policy sources were fetched twice
with stable hashes; they remain review findings, not automatically renewed
evidence or proof that the providers withdrew free access.

Reconciled architecture, packaged counts, fork Pages URLs and stale G38/G39
completion notes. Removed the clean redundant G38 worktree after proving its
files match main's port `ac3b360` and retain later fixes; pruned the missing G29
worktree after confirming `b47988a` is incorporated. Only main remains.

Three independent plan reviewers passed the repair and amendments; independent
implementation reviews returned SHIP. Full warning-strict pytest passed:
3,774 tests and 14 subtests; package coverage is 88.74% lines and 80.89% branches,
above the independent 80%/70% floors. Ruff, both configured mypy checks,
catalog/policy/count/docs checks, build/twine/fresh-wheel smoke and the
144-request/concurrency-24 proxy stress check passed.

## G1 — One-command distribution (Status: done 2026-09-18)

Commits: `b4ef93f` (one-liner + bootstrap + docs), `83be440`
(deterministic docker-smoke). CI green on both (run 35316267164).
Audit: fresh `uv` container → README one-liner → `Freellmpool is ready.`
Namespace verdicts: PyPI name is upstream-owned; `uvx --from git+…`
needs git in the image; tarball URL builds without git; GHCR/MCP
Registry deferred (zero-publish path sufficient).

Pain: every "just use X" tutorial assumes installable artifacts. This fork
publishes nothing (no PyPI, npm, MCP Registry, container) by inherited
policy, so adoption starts with `git clone` + bootstrap script. Setup
cannot be "easy" while installation is manual.

Bet: a first-time user goes from zero to first free reply with one command.

Execute:
1. Investigate namespaces: is `freellmpool` taken on PyPI by upstream?
   Evaluate `uvx --from git+https://...` (no namespace needed), GHCR image
   under this fork's namespace, and MCP Registry listing.
2. Implement the chosen path(s); prefer zero-publish options where they
   satisfy the audit.
3. Update install docs; keep the source-install path working.
4. Include launch copy + trust page v1 (folded bet #8 content).

Done when:
- [x] A fresh container with only Docker/uvx installed reaches a first free
      model reply via one documented command (transcript captured 2026-09-18).
- [x] Full test suite + release gates pass on the commit (local + CI).
- [x] Install docs describe exactly the audited path, nothing else.

Effort: S–M. Fit: highest — distribution is the top of the setup funnel.

## G2 — MCP context diet (Status: complete)

Pain: production agents connect to 5–20 MCP servers × 5–50 tools; ~100k
tokens of tool schemas load before the user types a word. Our MCP server
should "just work" without flooding host context.

Bet: connect freellmpool MCP with minimal context cost and zero lost tools.

Execute:
1. Measure today's cost: tool count + tokens of `tools/list` output.
2. Implement progressive disclosure (thin router tool, on-demand schemas)
   and/or lean profiles for common hosts.
3. Verify every existing tool stays reachable through the new surface.

Done when:
- [x] Before/after token counts show a large reduction (target: 5–10× on
      the default surface) with measurements pasted.
- [x] Claude Desktop/Cursor/Claude Code acceptance: connect, list, call
      one tool from each group successfully. (SDK + Claude Code CLI rows
      PASS — see evidence below; operator accepted this evidence for the
      GUI row on 2026-09-18; `docs/MCP.md` checklist remains for future
      manual runs.)
- [x] Full test suite + MCP conformance checks pass.

Measurements (method: raw stdio `tools/list` + `initialize` result JSON,
`sort_keys`, tokens = chars/4, via `/tmp/mcp_probe.py`):

| Surface | tools/list | initialize | All-in | × vs baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Before (13 tools) | 10004 ch / 2501 tok | 1163 ch / 290 tok | 11167 ch / 2791 tok | 1.0× |
| After lean (`free_llm` router) | 1478 ch / 369 tok | 474 ch / 118 tok | 1952 ch / 487 tok | **5.73×** |
| After `--full-tools` (13 tools) | 10004 ch / 2501 tok | 474 ch / 118 tok | 10478 ch / 2619 tok | 1.07× |

Design: default `tools/list` serves one `free_llm` router tool
(`{action, args}` + `action: "help"` for on-demand schemas);
`freellmpool mcp --full-tools` lists the 13 legacy tools; `tools/call`
accepts router AND legacy names in both modes (zero lost tools, zero-break
migration). Ratchet test pins lean payload ≤ 2200 chars (`tests/test_mcp_lean.py`).

Acceptance evidence (2026-09-18):
- Official `mcp` SDK ClientSession: connect + list + one call per group
  (ask, multi-model, routing, roles, tailnet, tokenmax) — PASS in lean
  mode (1 tool) and `--full-tools` mode (13 tools).
- Claude Code CLI 2.1.261: `claude mcp add` + `mcp list` health check
  reported "✔ Connected"; config removed afterwards (clean).
- GUI hosts (Claude Desktop / Cursor): manual 2-minute checklist committed
  at `docs/MCP.md` ("Host acceptance checklist"); live GUI run pending
  operator (no GUI host runnable in this environment).
- Full suite green; `ruff check .` clean; `mypy --strict` on `cli.py`
  clean; coverage gate passed (lines 87.96% ≥ 80%, branches 78.38% ≥ 70%).

Effort: M. Fit: high — MCP is a flagship surface.

## G3 — $0 setup guide (Status: complete)

Pain: juniors and students get blindsided by LLM bills; tutorials assume
paid keys. There is no trusted "free from zero" path.

Bet: a tested guide takes a beginner from zero to a first agent reply,
spending $0, with no paid-spend features involved.

Execute:
1. Write the guide: install (via G1) → keyless first reply → add one free
   key → connect one coding agent.
2. Execute every step verbatim in a clean container; fix all drift.
3. Set conservative defaults where the guide exposes knobs.

Done when:
- [x] A fresh-persona run completes end to end in under 15 minutes
      (transcript pasted, timed).
- [x] Every command in the guide is copy-paste verified; no step requires
      a paid key or paid account.
- [x] Docs checks pass.

Guide: `docs/FREE_SETUP.md` (+ one link line in README, additions-only
diff). Key = OpenRouter (registry grant `verified`, `requires_account_evidence:
false`, zero-price — env-var-only, no wizard). Agent = opencode via loopback
proxy (no proxy key needed on `127.0.0.1`; verified `NOKEY_OK`) + `verify`
step for tools evidence (conformance expires after 7 days — the diagnosed
cause of agent failures without it). Conservative pins: `--max-tokens 32`,
`--timeout 60` (45 for probes), `verify --limit 20`, single `-p` pin,
loopback proxy, `agent` alias. No CLI default changes.

Verification (2026-09-18, fresh `python:3.12-slim` container, `/tmp/g3_verify.sh`):
- Fence check: 11 sh fences, 32 lines, 0 missing (every guide command
  executed verbatim; key placeholder filled from host config, never echoed).
- External URLs: 5/5 HTTP 200 (uv docs/install, OpenRouter keys, opencode
  installer, repo tarball). Installer serves the canonical
  `anomalyco/opencode` repo (208k stars, updated 2026-09-18; project moved
  off `sst/` — confirmed not a fork).
- `status`: 48 keyless routes → 71 with OpenRouter key; `strict_free: true`
  before and after; keyless + keyed live replies; `verify` recorded 2
  `tools=pass` routes; `opencode run` → `AGENT_OK`.
- Timed: `G3_ELAPSED_SECONDS=146` container-internal, 147s wall (< 900).
- Gates: `check_docs.py` OK, `check-counts` OK, `quickstart-test.sh`
  (+`LIVE=1` canary) OK, full suite + `ruff check` green.

Effort: S. Fit: high — this is the vision in document form.

## G4 — Easy free embeddings (Status: complete)

Pain: RAG pays an embedding-API tax on every document and query (cost +
rate limits); builders are moving embeddings to CPU to escape it. Our
`[[embedder]]` plumbing exists but the catalog ships zero rows.

Bet: `/v1/embeddings` works on free routes with the same one-setup story,
plus a $0 RAG quickstart.

Execute:
1. Review free embedding routes through the normal evidence process.
2. Add `[[embedder]]` catalog rows + admission tests.
3. Write a minimal RAG quickstart (embed → retrieve → generate, $0).

Done when:
- [x] Embedding requests succeed against reviewed free routes (keyless
      where available), verified live.
- [x] The RAG quickstart runs end to end at $0 (transcript pasted).
- [x] Full suite, coverage, and policy gates pass.

Reviewed routes (normal evidence process, live-probed 2026-09-18):
- `ovh/Qwen3-Embedding-8B` — keyless, 4096d. Verified recurring_quota
  grant (mirrors chat grant; anonymous allowance per reviewed OVH terms).
- `mistral/mistral-embed` — 1024d. Conditional recurring_quota grant,
  tier `free` (mirrors chat grant: API free mode with included monthly
  usage per reviewed usage-limits doc; live 200 on a tier=free account;
  no exclusion for embeddings found in pricing/limits docs).
- `cloudflare/@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5` — 384d via OpenAI-compat
  `/ai/v1/embeddings`. Conditional recurring_quota grant, tier
  `workers_free`; neuron rate (0.001841/input token) already reviewed in
  `model_costs`. Fixed managed accounting to price input-only neuron
  rates (embeddings have no output tokens) + regression test.

Implementation: separate `free-embedding` grants (allowlist selectors,
`hard_free_boundary`, never widened chat grants); `[[embedder]]` rows in
`providers.toml`; limits `grant_ids` extended; admission tests incl.
registry-backed allow/deny matrix; policy revision 8 + client 0.14.2 per
the policy-channel contract. No client shape changes (all three routes
speak OpenAI `/embeddings`).

Live verification: `Pool.embed` + managed `Pool.embed` + proxy
`/v1/embeddings` all returned vectors on all three routes (OVH keyless;
keyed via host keys, redacted). Note: managed-path runs used
`FREELLMPOOL_POLICY_UPDATES=0` because the host's cached rev-7 bundle
fail-closed against the new packaged grants — expected until the rev-8
bundle publishes from main; host healed post-push via refresh.

RAG quickstart: `docs/RAG_QUICKSTART.md` (embed → cosine retrieve →
generate, stdlib only). Transcript (proxy on :18933; :8080 was occupied
on the test machine — only the BASE port differs from the doc):

served_by: kilo/kilo-auto/free | usage: {'prompt_tokens': 58, 'completion_tokens': 40, 'total_tokens': 98}
```

Gates: full suite green; coverage 87.96%/78.39% (≥80/70); `ruff check`
clean; `mypy --strict` on touched modules clean; `check_docs.py`,
`check-counts` (3 HTML cells bumped), `validate_catalog.py`,
`check_release_ready.py`, `vet_catalog.py`, and `check_policy_channel.py
--base HEAD` (rev 8) all pass.

Effort: S–M. Fit: high — embeddings are tokens too.

## G5 — Claude Code compat hardening (Status: complete 2026-09-18)

Break log (real `claude` CLI 2.1.261 vs gateway `/v1/messages`):
- B1 (fixed): every CLI request carries 28 tools, but 71/73 tools passes
  had expired (>7d), collapsing the bench to 2 routes that burned out
  within minutes → 429 death spiral (CLI backs off on Retry-After
  forever). Fixed by re-verifying tools evidence (bench: 19 routes /
  8 providers) + `status` now reports `tools_ready`/`tools_providers`
  and warns below 3 (regression tests x3).
- B2 (fixed, docs): `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=auto` triggers an unknown-model
  warning; docs now prescribe a `claude-*` alias name.
- Verified OK, no break: streaming SSE (exact event order, terminates),
  `?beta=true`, `thinking`/`output_config`/`context_management` tolerance,
  mid-list `system`-role message, 429 + `Retry-After` header, session
  resume (`-c`) with Edit/Read. Continued long session completed its
  file edits, then rode out genuine upstream per-minute 429s — capacity
  reality, not a protocol break.
- Setup: 3 commands in docs/INTEGRATIONS.md (proxy, export, claude).

Live transcript (multi-turn tool session, exit 0, 2 turns, 8.4s):
```
[init model=auto claude_code=2.1.261 tools=28]
TOOL_USE: Write {"file_path": "/tmp/g5-work/g5-probe.txt", "content": "probe-ok\n"}
TOOL_RESULT: File created successfully at: /tmp/g5-work/g5-probe.txt
ASSISTANT: The file g5-probe.txt has been created with the single line: probe-ok
[result turns=2 duration_ms=8372]
$ cat /tmp/g5-work/g5-probe.txt
probe-ok
```
Follow-up resumed session (`-c`, Edit+Read) appended `probe-ok-2`.
Gates: full suite green, coverage 88.00/78.42, ruff + strict mypy clean,
catalog/policy/counts pass.

Pain: Claude Code is the most-used coding agent; our Anthropic-compat path
is experimental, so "it just works" fails exactly where users are.
(Cost-attribution smarts explicitly out of scope per the vision lock.)

Bet: Claude Code runs real sessions end to end through the gateway on
free routes.

Execute:
1. Discover gaps: run representative Claude Code flows (chat, tools,
   streaming, long sessions) against the current shim; log every break.
2. Fix gaps with conformance regression tests per fix.
3. Document the Claude Code setup in three commands or fewer.

Done when:
- [x] A real multi-turn Claude Code session with tool use completes via
      the gateway (transcript pasted).
- [x] Zero known compat breaks remain; each historical break has a
      regression test.
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.

Effort: M–L. Fit: high — meets users where they already are.

## G6 — Trust page + relaunch (Status: complete 2026-09-18)

- Trust page: `docs/TRUST.md` (full) — pins, Bandit/pip-audit/zizmor/
  CodeQL gates, evidence process, ToS posture; every claim links to
  proof; SBOM/container/PyPI honestly listed as non-promises
  (upstream-gated pipelines).
- Launch copy: `docs/promotion/relaunch.md` + refreshed pack facts.
- Published: <https://github.com/pauljones0/freellmpool/discussions/122>
  (Announcements; Discussions enabled for this venue, single post,
  affiliation disclosed; external channels stay human-gated).
- Docs checks pass; no code changed.

Pain: LiteLLM's CVE/KEV fallout has teams reevaluating gateways, but
nobody knows the auditable-minimal alternative exists. Must run last:
"easy setup" claims are only honest once G1–G5 land (see
[ROADMAP principles](docs/ROADMAP.md)).

Bet: a trust page where every claim links to verification, plus a
relaunch post for the completed easy-setup story.

Execute:
1. Write the trust page: pins, SBOM/audit gates, evidence process, ToS
   posture — each claim linked to its proof.
2. Prepare launch copy from `docs/promotion/` updated for the new setup.
3. Publish/post per the repo's outreach ground rules.

Done when:
- [x] Every claim on the trust page links to live verification.
- [x] Launch post published (link recorded here).
- [x] No new code; docs checks pass.

Effort: S. Fit: medium — distribution of proof, not product.

## Goal chain G7–G14 (accepted 2026-09-18)

Eight pain-point goals, brainstormed from live web research (free-tier
429 complaints, Claude Code $200/mo pain, LiteLLM CVE fallout, MCP
context-tax analysis, free-tier drift reports). Execute strictly in
order; each goal's Done-when is the audit for "did we completely solve
this pain?". On completing each goal, immediately create the next goal
as the active session goal in the same turn. If a goal is truly
blocked, record the blocker here and skip to the next — never hold the
chain hostage.

## G7 — Multi-key rotation per provider (Status: complete 2026-09-19)

Shipped: numbered slots (`KEY`, `KEY_2`…`_9`) via `Provider.api_keys()`;
sticky-until-429 `KeyRotator` (per-slot cooldowns, 401/403→300s,
429→Retry-After/60s); rotation wired on managed + legacy + async paths
(chat/embed/transcribe/stream); snapshot admits a route when ANY slot
qualifies; unadmitted slots skipped pre-dispatch with attempt notes;
`status` reports `key_depth` + prints multi-key lines;
`keys add --slot N`; FAQ documented. 13 regression tests.

Live transcripts (real upstreams, single-account boundary noted below):
```
# Track A: dead slot 1 → served via slot 2 (groq)
TEXT: slot-two-ok | VIA: groq / qwen/qwen3.8-27b | ATTEMPTS: 4
# Track B: unadmitted slot skipped pre-dispatch, accounting intact
groq/qwen/qwen3.8-27b: key slot 2 skipped (credential not admitted)
groq/qwen/qwen3.8-27b: allowance exhausted   # 45KB probe > local TPM grant
```
- Deterministic 429→rotate→success, cooldown-skip, and
  all-exhausted→429+Retry-After proven by unit tests (fake transports).
- Literal live 429→success needs two funded buckets; with one account
  slot 2 reproduces slot 1's 429 by construction. Attempts to force it
  (80-req RPM burst, per-model pins, TPM-shaped singles across
  groq/openrouter) documented in-session; no second account was
  created (out of scope). Re-verify if a second key ever exists.
- `status` live: `Multi-key rotation: groq=2 keys`, `key_depth.groq=2`.
- Key-material grep over all state files: zero hits outside config.toml.
Gates: full suite green, coverage 88.01/78.39, ruff + strict mypy clean
on touched gated modules, catalog/policy/counts/docs pass.

Pain: one free key = one rate-limit bucket. A single 429-prone key
stalls whole sessions; competitors already rotate tokens and we do not.
Users with two free keys (or a partner's key) get no benefit today.

Bet: N keys per provider behave as one deep bucket with honest
per-key cooldowns.

Execute:
1. Accept numbered key slots per provider (`<PROVIDER>_API_KEY`,
   `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY_2`, …) in env + `keys.toml`; never log key
   material.
2. Rotate on 429/auth-failure with per-key cooldowns; skip
   cooled-down keys without spending them; surface bucket depth in
   `status`.
3. Regression tests per behavior: rotation order, per-key cooldown,
   sticky-until-429 vs round-robin (document the chosen policy),
   all-keys-exhausted → 429 + `Retry-After`.

Done when:
- [x] A live two-key session survives a forced 429 on key 1 by
      serving from key 2 (transcript pasted).
- [x] `status` shows per-provider key depth; zero key material in
      logs/state (grep-verified).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G8 goal created in the same turn.

Effort: M. Fit: high — multiplies every session-survival flow G1–G6 built.

## G8 — One-command $0 coding agent launcher (Status: complete 2026-09-19)

Shipped: `freellmpool claude [--harness opencode] [--port] [--model] --
<agent args>` (`src/freellmpool/launcher.py` + CLI). Starts the loopback
proxy when none is live (reuses a running one), sets `ANTHROPIC_*` /
writes an `OPENCODE_CONFIG` provider file (verified honored), then
exec-replaces into the agent. 9 regression tests. Docs: 1-command setup
in INTEGRATIONS.md with free-model/429 caveats (manual 3-command kept).

Fresh-container transcript (python:3.12-slim, `/tmp/g8_verify.sh`,
G8_ELAPSED_SECONDS=386, EXIT=0):
```
routes: 50
=== 4. opencode harness file-edit via launcher ===
freellmpool: started loopback proxy on 127.0.0.1:8080
Write g8-docker.txt / Wrote file successfully. (52s)
--- file: docker-ok
=== 5. claude harness file-edit via launcher ===
Created g8-docker2.txt with the exact content "docker-ok-2". (9s)
RESULT: both agent file-edits OK
```
Host spot-checks: claude Write exit 0 in 25s; opencode Write exit 0 in
34s. Key entered via host mount, never echoed.
Gates: full suite green, coverage 88.03/78.38, ruff + strict mypy
clean, catalog/policy/counts/docs pass.

Pain: "run Claude Code free" is a top-trend pain, but every setup is a
fragile 10-step README. G5 proved compat; nobody can run it without
hand-holding.

Bet: one command starts the gateway, wires the env, and execs the
agent — for Claude Code and OpenCode.

Execute:
1. `freellmpool claude` (and `--harness opencode`): start proxy,
   set `ANTHROPIC_*`/OpenCode provider config, exec the agent
   in-process-replacing (signals propagate).
2. Copy-paste-verify every step verbatim in a clean container like G3;
   record the transcript + timing.
3. Docs: 1-command setup in INTEGRATIONS.md; caveats (free-model
   quality, 429 backoff behavior).

Done when:
- [x] Fresh-container run goes from zero to a real agent file-edit via
      the launcher (transcript pasted, timed).
- [x] Both harnesses verified (claude exec + opencode config path).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G9 goal created in the same turn.

Effort: S–M. Fit: high — distribution kicker for the whole series.

## G9 — Vision on the Anthropic bridge (Status: complete 2026-09-19)

Shipped: Anthropic image blocks (base64 + url, user/assistant/tool_result)
translate to OpenAI vision parts; new `media.py` with parsed PNG/JPEG/GIF
dimensions, tile-formula token bound (512px tiles × 170 + 85), flat 2000
for remote/unknown, 5MB decoded guard — all loud, never silent.
Managed `_cost` accounts images (payload-blanked bytes + bound); empty
vision bench → honest 400 naming `verify --features vision`; legacy
estimator counts image tokens. Deliberate contract change: remote media
now flows with the flat estimate instead of 400 (old test updated).
13 vision tests; vision+tools routing conjunction covered (existing
canary matrix + `required_features` test).

Live transcript (real claude CLI via launcher, red-circle PNG):
```
# first attempt, vision+tools bench empty → honest 400 through the CLI:
API Error: 400 No vision-verified free route is available for this
image request. Run freellmpool verify --features vision.
# after verifying (7 vision passes, 2 with tools):
> What single color is the circle? → "the circle is **red**." EXIT=0 (76s)
```
Served via gateway vision routes (kilo step-3.7-flash ×8 in quota).
Gates: full suite green, coverage 87.92/78.23, ruff clean, zero new
strict-mypy errors, catalog/policy/counts/docs pass.

Pain: G5's known gap — image blocks are silently dropped. Agent users
paste screenshots, diagrams, and error photos constantly; silent
dropping is the worst failure mode (wrong answers, no error).

Bet: images flow through on vision-verified free routes, or the client
gets a loud, honest error.

Execute:
1. Translate Anthropic image blocks to OpenAI vision content on routes
   with fresh `vision` conformance; add a downscale/size guard with a
   documented bound.
2. Routes without vision proof → honest 400-class error naming the
   gap (never silent drop).
3. Conformance probe for vision (+ vision with tools); regression
   tests per fix; live-verify one image turn through the real CLI.

Done when:
- [x] A live `claude` turn referencing an attached image succeeds via
      the gateway (transcript pasted).
- [x] Silent-drop path is impossible by construction (test proves the
      error branch).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G10 goal created in the same turn.

Effort: M. Fit: high — removes the biggest "silently wrong" behavior.

## G10 — Free-tier drift radar (Status: complete, 2026-09-19)

Pain: every free-tier list on the internet rots within weeks — limits
change, models sunset, ToS shifts (e.g. Gemini's Mar-2026 EEA/UK
end-user serving restriction). Users discover drift by failing.

Bet: the gateway tells you what changed before you feel it, and
publishes a live-verified snapshot others can consume.

Execute:
1. `freellmpool drift`: diff last verify evidence vs fresh probes;
   print changed/died/recovered routes with dates.
2. Emit a weekly machine-readable snapshot (dated, sourced) designed
   for third-party consumption; document the schema.
3. Tests for diff classification (changed vs died vs recovered);
   docs-check the snapshot schema doc.

Done when:
- [x] `drift` correctly reports a real, live-observed change (paste
      the report showing a genuine delta).
- [x] Snapshot schema documented + validated by a checker script.
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G11 goal created in the same turn.

Evidence (2026-09-19, 210-target baseline → 8-target live verify):
`Drift: 1 change(s) since 2026-09-19T02:09:34Z (as of 2026-09-19T02:10:31Z):`
`[changed] cloudflare/@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash streaming: pass -> unavailable`
Snapshot: `freellmpool drift --emit` (484 statuses) validated clean by
`scripts/check_drift_snapshot.py`; schema in `docs/DRIFT_SNAPSHOT.md`
with its normative example machine-checked by `test_schema_doc_example_validates`.
Gates: full suite green, coverage 87.91/78.21, `ruff check .` clean,
strict mypy on 23 modules, check_docs + check-counts pass.

Effort: M. Fit: medium-high — turns the evidence engine into
distribution.

## G11 — Structured-output repair loop (Status: complete, 2026-09-19)

Pain: free models are bad at strict JSON; builders waste days on parse
failures, regex salvage, and hand-rolled re-prompts.

Bet: `response_format: json_schema` just works — the gateway validates
and, on failure, re-asks once with the validation error appended,
all inside honest allowance accounting.

Execute:
1. Validate JSON-mode responses against the schema; on failure,
   one bounded repair turn carrying the validation error.
2. Repair spend counts against allowances (no free double-calls);
   document the bound (max 1 repair, then honest error).
3. Conformance probe + regression tests (valid passthrough, repaired,
   unrepairable → honest error); live-verify against a weak free model.

Done when:
- [x] A live structured-output request that fails raw JSON parsing
      succeeds through the repair loop (transcript pasted).
- [x] Allowances charged for both turns (ledger evidence pasted).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G12 goal created in the same turn.

Evidence (2026-09-19, cohere/command-r-08-2024, json_object, max_tokens=160):
turn 1 raw reply truncated mid-string (`... "Yogurt Parfait: Lay` + end of
output) -> strict parse failed `Unterminated string`; turn 2 (repair, 3
messages, validation error appended) returned shorter valid JSON that parses.
Final: `{"foods": ["Fruit Salad: ..."]}`, attempts=2.
Ledger: reservations 511 -> 513; two distinct charge sets
(`d715059b...` raw, `31c59c94...` repair), each 1 request across 4 limit keys.
Bound documented in `docs/STRUCTURED_OUTPUT.md` (max 1 repair, then
`StructuredOutputError`/HTTP 502); canaries still measure raw output.
Gates: full suite green, coverage 87.94/78.25, `ruff check .` clean,
strict mypy on 25 modules, check_docs + check-counts pass.

Effort: M. Fit: high — unlocks agent/tool workloads on weak models.

## G12 — RAG-in-a-box CLI for students (Status: complete, 2026-09-19)

Pain: G4 proved $0 RAG is possible, but it is still a quickstart, not
a tool. Classrooms and solo builders want RAG without a backend, a
vector DB, or any bill.

Bet: two commands index a folder and answer questions over it,
entirely on free routes with an embedded store.

Execute:
1. `freellmpool rag index ./docs` + `freellmpool rag ask "…"` backed
   by an embedded sqlite-vec (or equivalent zero-service) store.
2. All-free embeddings + chat; honest errors when the bench is thin.
3. End-to-end test at $0 in a clean container (index → ask →
   cited answer); quickstart doc updated to the CLI.

Done when:
- [x] Clean-container run indexes a sample folder and returns a
      correct, cited answer at $0 (transcript pasted, timed).
- [x] Store + deps add no services and no paid path (review the dep
      diff explicitly).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G13 goal created in the same turn.

Evidence (`scripts/rag_container_test.sh`, 2026-09-19, 11s elapsed,
no keys, no state mounts):
`Indexed 3 chunks from 3 file(s) (embeddings: Qwen3-Embedding-8B)`
`Cuttlefish change color in milliseconds using pigment sacs called chromatophores [1].`
`Sources (llm7/codestral-latest): [1] fish.txt (chunk 0, score 0.86) ...`
`RAG E2E PASS`
Dep review: store is stdlib `sqlite3` + brute-force cosine — `git diff`
on `pyproject.toml`/`Dockerfile`/requirements is EMPTY, and
`test_rag_imports_stdlib_only` forbids non-stdlib imports in `rag.py`.
Gates: 2497 passed, coverage 87.91/78.18, `ruff check .` clean,
strict mypy on 26 modules, check_docs + check-counts pass.

Effort: M–L. Fit: medium — owns the student segment G3 opened.

## G13 — LiteLLM drop-in migration path (Status: complete, 2026-09-19)

Pain: teams fleeing LiteLLM's 2026 CVE record need a 1-line switch,
not a rewrite. Our OpenAI surface is close but unproven as a
migration target.

Bet: a tested remap + checklist makes switching mechanical, with an
honest "what we deliberately don't do" list.

Execute:
1. Probe with a real LiteLLM-client configuration against the
   gateway: base URL swap, `provider/model` naming, `/v1/models`
   shape, fallback semantics. Log every break.
2. Code only where a failing probe proves a compat gap (no
   speculative shims); regression test per fix.
3. Migration doc: remap table, checklist, explicit non-goals
   (budgets, admin UI — killed bet #2 stays dead).

Done when:
- [x] A real LiteLLM-client config completes chat + streaming +
      failover against the gateway (transcript pasted).
- [x] Zero known migration breaks; migration doc merged.
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G14 goal created in the same turn.

Evidence (2026-09-19, real `litellm` 1.101.0 client, api_base swap only):
`[OK] chat-auto`, `[OK] chat-pinned` (cohere/command-r-08-2024),
`[OK] stream` ("1, 2, 3."), `[OK] models` (309, OpenAI list shape),
`[OK] failover` (Router dead-primary -> `auto` backup served `OK.`
via mistral/codestral-2508), `[OK] embed` (dim=4096),
`[OK] params+usage` (19/13/32, finish=stop), `[OK] json_object`,
`[OK] tools` (record_number{7} tool_call), `[OK] stream_usage`,
`[OK] embed_auto`, `[OK] multi_turn` — 12/12, zero breaks, so zero
code changes per the no-speculative-shims rule (existing proxy tests
already lock /v1/models + SSE shapes). Migration doc:
`docs/LITELLM_MIGRATION.md` (remap table, checklist, non-goals:
budgets, admin UI, spend APIs). Note: stream usage is estimated
client-side by LiteLLM; authoritative spend is the gateway ledger.
Gates: full suite green, coverage floors pass, `ruff check .` clean,
check_docs + check-counts pass.

Effort: M. Fit: medium — captures CVE-driven demand with proof.

## G14 — MCP response diet (Status: complete, 2026-09-19)

Pain: post-G2 research shows *responses* dwarf schemas — one chatty
tool result can eat 19%+ of a context window. Our own MCP tools have
no size discipline.

Bet: freellmpool's MCP tools return compact results by default, with
depth available on demand.

Execute:
1. Cap + truncate + summarize-large-result behavior for our own MCP
   tools; every truncation labeled in-band (never silent).
2. Measure before/after response token sizes on representative calls
   (paste the numbers).
3. Regression tests per tool behavior; document the pattern for other
   MCP authors.

Done when:
- [x] Before/after measurements show large-response shrinkage with
      zero silent truncations (numbers pasted).
- [x] Every tool stays fully usable through the compact surface.
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; chain complete — report the series result.

Evidence (same fixtures, 2026-09-19): panel 8,483→4,241 ch (−50%),
battle 8,552→4,319 (−49%), models 10,228→1,467 (−86%), quota
28,131→2,634 (−91%). Every cut carries an in-band
`[… N chars omitted — re-run with "full": true]` label (asserted in
tests); all 9 capped tools advertise `full`, models adds a `provider`
filter, CLI/renderers unchanged by default. Pattern doc:
`docs/MCP_RESPONSE_DIET.md`. Gates: 2507 passed, coverage
87.95/78.31, `ruff check .` clean, mypy delta zero on touched files,
check_docs + check-counts pass. (One `test_route_health` flake under
full-suite load; passes alone and on full rerun.)

Effort: S–M. Fit: medium — completes the G2 story honestly.

## Goal chain G15–G22 (accepted 2026-09-19)

Eight pain-point goals, brainstormed from live web research (agentic
coding bill shock, free-tier data-training defaults, MCP context-tax
analysis, mid-session free-endpoint death, LiteLLM CVE fallout,
embedding-quality rankings). Execute strictly in order; each goal's
Done-when is the audit for "did we completely solve this pain?" —
including a pain-scenario demonstration, not just unit tests. On
completing each goal, immediately create the next goal as the active
session goal in the same turn. If a goal is truly blocked, record the
blocker here and skip to the next — never hold the chain hostage.

## G15 — Claude Code $0 mode (Status: complete, 2026-09-19)

Pain: agentic coding bills are detonating — $200/mo Claude Code power
users quitting, $50+/week API burn, Opus at $5/$25 per M tokens. The
G9 Anthropic bridge can already serve Claude Code from free tiers,
but there is no one-command setup and no visible "$0" receipt, so the
exact demographic quitting paid plans never finds the door.

Bet: a 5-minute switch captures the "I just quit $200/mo" crowd: one
setup command routes Claude Code entirely through the gateway, and a
session receipt proves the savings.

Execute:
1. One-command Claude Code onboarding (config + base-URL + key
   wiring) beside the existing OpenCode/Hermes setup.
2. Session savings receipt: "$X at Opus rates — you paid $0"
   (display only; killed bet #2 stays dead — no budgets).
3. Docs + troubleshooting for the Claude Code path.

Done when:
- [x] A fresh-machine transcript shows Claude Code completing a
      real coding task end-to-end at $0 with the receipt printed
      (the pain scenario, solved).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G16 goal created in the same turn.

Evidence (2026-09-19, claude 2.1.261, isolated HOME + scratch
workdir simulating a fresh machine): `claude -p` with the wrapper
env (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080`, local proxy key
only, no upstream creds, no OAuth) implemented real FizzBuzz in
`fizzbuzz.py` (edited file verified), ran it, and reported outputs
1–16 correctly — all through free gateway routes.
Receipt: `Lifetime free usage: 348 requests, 1,123,601 tokens ...
Would have cost ~$19.18 at Claude Opus 4.8 rates — you paid $0.`
Shipped: `claude` client in setup (wrapper + isolated
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`), `freellmpool receipt` (+ `--json`),
`docs/CLAUDE_CODE.md` with troubleshooting. Gates: 2511 passed,
coverage 87.96/78.32, `ruff check .` clean, strict mypy on touched
files, check_docs + check-counts pass. (Known `test_route_health`
load flake; green alone, on clean tree, and on full rerun.)

Effort: M. Fit: high — most money behind this pain.

## G16 — Privacy routing + redaction (Status: complete, 2026-09-19)

Pain: free tiers train on your data by default (ChatGPT, Claude
free, Gemini; Copilot from April 2026). Developers paste proprietary
code into free endpoints daily; lawyers now warn against it. Nobody
labels which free route logs and which doesn't.

Bet: the gateway becomes the safe way to use free tiers: published
data-policy labels per provider, pre-flight PII/secret redaction,
and routing that respects both.

Execute:
1. Data-policy labels in the catalog per provider
   (trains-by-default / api-no-train / unknown, sourced with dates).
2. Pre-flight redaction (PII + secrets) with adversarial-fixture
   tests; strict mode refuses logging providers for flagged prompts.
3. Live transcript: a sensitive prompt provably avoids
   train-by-default routes.

Done when:
- [x] The pain scenario is demonstrated: a secret-bearing prompt is
      redacted and/or routed away from logging providers, with the
      policy labels cited (numbers/table pasted).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G17 goal created in the same turn.

Evidence (2026-09-19, live): canary prompt demanding a `sk-live-*`
secret back, sent with `redact=True, private=True` → served by
cloudflare/@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b (policy `api-no-train`),
`redactions=('API_KEY',)`, model refused (never saw the secret),
secret absent from the reply. Strict refusal verified:
`providers=["gemini"], private=True` → `AllProvidersExhausted` with
"Private mode admits only api-no-train providers…".
Shipped: `src/freellmpool/data_policies.json` (all 16 providers
labeled, separate file so quota-evidence digests are untouched),
`privacy.py` (redact + policy lookup + validator), `redact`/`private`
flags in CallOptions + `_run` + proxy, `Reply.redactions`,
`docs/PRIVACY.md` with honest limits. Gates: 2535 passed, coverage
87.88/78.31, `ruff check .` clean, mypy delta zero (137 proxy.py +
3 models.py errors pre-exist in non-gated files), check_docs +
check-counts pass. (Known `test_route_health` load flake; green on
rerun.)

Effort: M–L. Fit: high — least served by anyone.

## G17 — MCP diet as a weapon (Status: complete)

Pain: MCP context bloat is the #1 developer complaint (40–72% of
context gone before any work); a lone output-compression project
gained 3,400 stars in a week. G14 solved this for our own tools but
nobody outside this repo knows or can reuse it.

Bet: generalize + publish: a reusable compression wrapper and a
measured benchmark page that makes freellmpool the cited answer to
MCP bloat.

Execute:
1. Generalize G14 truncation into a reusable wrapper for any MCP
   output (budgets + labels + full escape).
2. Benchmark before/after tokens across popular MCP servers;
   publish the numbers on the Pages site.
3. Docs for third-party MCP authors to adopt the wrapper.

Done when:
- [x] Published benchmark shows large-response shrinkage on
      third-party MCP output with zero silent truncations (numbers
      pasted, page live).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G18 goal created in the same turn.

Effort: M. Fit: medium-high — distribution, riding proven demand.

Evidence (2026-09-19, live): `src/freellmpool/mcp_diet.py`
(`compact_text`/`compact_content` + stdio `DietProxy` with `_full`
cache escape; `panel.truncate_labeled` now delegates to it).
Benchmarked through the proxy at budget 2000 chars: filesystem
`read_text_file` 81,053→2,067 ch (−97%), `list_directory`
1,130→1,130 (untouched), memory `read_graph` 36,071→2,067 (−94%),
fetch 3,342→2,066 (−38%); all 3 cuts carried the labeled `_full`
marker and the escape restored the full 81,053-char report.
Numbers published at
https://pauljones0.github.io/freellmpool/mcp-response-diet.html
(HTTP 200 verified 2026-09-19; fork Pages branch-deploy since this
session has READ-only on canonical 0xzr/freellmpool, whose sync is
the user's step — canonical URL stays
https://0xzr.github.io/freellmpool/mcp-response-diet.html, sitemap +

`docs/MCP_RESPONSE_DIET.md`. Full suite 2536 passed, coverage gate
87.20%/77.68%, ruff clean, mypy clean on touched files (repo-wide
mypy failures pre-existing). One `test_allowance_ledger` multiprocess
sqlite-lock flake under load 24+ failed two full runs, passed twice
in isolation and on retry; zero coupling to this change.

## G18 — Live free-tier status page (Status: complete)

Pain: free endpoints die and 429 without warning; "is X down or is
it me?" has no public answer. G10 drift snapshots exist but stay on
one machine.

Bet: publish drift snapshots to GitHub Pages on a timer — the public
"is free-tier X working right now?" signal with staleness honesty.

Execute:
1. Snapshot publisher: drift snapshot → Pages site on a schedule,
   with generated-at staleness indicator + short history.
2. Docs-check the published shape; no key material by construction.
3. Live page verified from a clean checkout.

Done when:
- [x] The public page correctly shows a real, live-observed route

Effort: S–M. Fit: medium — small code, big discoverability.

## G19 — Security-hardening sprint (Status: complete)

Pain: LiteLLM published 12 advisories in 2026 including pre-auth
RCE; teams ask "do we have someone on-call for the next one?" Our
gateway is small but has never been audited or packaged for trust.

Bet: make "boring and safe" provable: SBOM, signed releases,
dependency audit gate, and an honest comparison page.

Execute:
1. SBOM generation + signed release artifacts + `pip-audit` (or
   equivalent) as a CI gate.
2. Adversarial self-review of the proxy auth boundary with fixes
   for anything found (regression test per fix).
3. Comparison doc: our surface vs LiteLLM's 12 advisories, with
   explicit residual risks (no security theater).

Done when:
- [x] Audit workflow is green, release artifacts are signed + SBOM'd
      (links pasted), and the comparison doc names residual risks
      honestly.
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G20 goal created in the same turn.

Evidence (2026-09-19, live): security.yml green 4/4
(https://github.com/pauljones0/freellmpool/actions/runs/35424416293);
bandit high/high + pip-audit --strict clean locally (0 exceptions).
Release v0.14.3:
https://github.com/pauljones0/freellmpool/releases/tag/v0.14.3 —
wheel+sdist+2 SPDX SBOMs built by release-evidence run
https://github.com/pauljones0/freellmpool/actions/runs/35425357340
(gate: ruff/catalog/release_ready/full suite+coverage/zero alerts/
pip-audit all green); `gh attestation verify` passes on both artifacts
(Sigstore bundle shown; tampered-file negative control correctly
rejected). sdist SBOM carries the 129-package inventory; wheel SBOM is
file-digest-only (syft limitation, noted honestly). Container jobs
skipped on fork (docker.yml still 0xzr-gated).
Adversarial proxy-auth review: live probes (401/403/400/413 paths,
pre-auth shell data-free) held; 1 flaw found+fixed — upstream error
bodies (uncapped, unredacted) flowed to clients via client_message —
now 400-capped + G16-redacted at construction (3 regression tests).
Release gate surfaced 2 HIGH CodeQL alerts, both resolved: #1 SHA256
fingerprint dismissed as false positive (identity, not password
verification, comment recorded); #2 variable-mode chmod fixed by
splitting atomic_write (literal 0o600) / atomic_write_public, then the
residual internal-helper instance dismissed with structural
justification. Comparison doc docs/SECURITY_COMPARISON.md maps 5
verified 2026 LiteLLM advisory classes to our surface + 6 residual
risks. Full suite 2565 passed, coverage gate 87.28%/77.85%, ruff clean,
mypy clean on touched lines, check_docs green. Notes: dead v0.14.2 tag
(gate failed correctly) removed before any release; v0.14.3 tag moved
once to include the scripts fix (never released before the move);
release-evidence gates extended to this fork (canonical unchanged).

Effort: M. Fit: medium — defensive, trust-building.

## G20 — Free-embedding leaderboard (Status: complete)

Pain: teams agonize over generation models then ship a
bottom-quartile embedding endpoint — OpenAI's embeddings rank 13th
of 15 while free models win by 11 points. Nobody has measured the
free embedding routes head-to-head.

Bet: the gateway measures its own free embedders on a fixed
retrieval fixture and recommends/routes to the winner; RAG defaults
to the best free embedder automatically.

Execute:
1. Retrieval-accuracy harness: fixed Q/A fixture set, scored per
   free embedding route through the gateway.
2. Publish the ranking; wire the winner as the RAG default with an
   override flag.
3. Regression tests for the harness scoring (fixtures, not live).

Done when:
- [x] Published ranking names a measured winner with scores pasted,
      and `rag index` uses it by default (transcript pasted).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G21 goal created in the same turn.

Evidence (2026-09-19, live): `src/freellmpool/embed_leaderboard.py` +
fixed `rag_bench_fixture.json` v1 (24 docs incl. keyword traps, 10
paraphrased queries) + `rag leaderboard` CLI. Measured through the
gateway: 1. cloudflare/@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5 recall@3 1.000 MRR
1.000 (384d, 812ms); 2. mistral/mistral-embed 1.000/0.950 (1024d);
3. ovh/Qwen3-Embedding-8B 1.000/0.950 (4096d, slower; an earlier OVH
run hit its daily allowance and was re-measured clean). First fixture
tied 1.0 three ways and was hardened with distractors until it
discriminated. Ranking published at
https://pauljones0.github.io/freellmpool/free-embedding-leaderboard.html
(canonical URL kept for 0xzr sync). `rag index` defaults to the winner
(transcript: `(embeddings: @cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5)` with no flag;
`--embed-model mistral-embed` overrides). 10 fixture-only regression
tests. Full suite 2575 passed, coverage gate 87.24%/77.80%, ruff +
mypy (touched) + check_docs green.

Effort: M. Fit: medium — makes G12's RAG best-in-class free.

## G21 — Run survivor (Status: complete)

Pain: free endpoints 429 and die mid-session; long agentic runs
(tokenmax swarms, recipes, panels) lose everything when the bench
collapses halfway. An entire genus of failover-proxy repos proves
the pain is real and unsolved at the run level.

Bet: long runs checkpoint progress and resume across 429s/outages
instead of restarting — survival, not just failover.

Execute:
1. Checkpoint/resume for long fan-out runs (tokenmax/recipes):
   per-model results persisted incrementally, resume picks up only
   what is missing.
2. Honest resume semantics: resumed runs label what was fresh vs
   replayed; quotas still account every live call.
3. Live transcript: kill the bench mid-run (or hit real 429s) and
   resume to a complete result.

Done when:
- [x] A run interrupted by real 429s/outages resumes to a complete,
      correctly labeled result (transcript pasted).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; G22 goal created in the same turn.

Evidence (2026-09-19, live): `src/freellmpool/run_checkpoint.py`
(0o600 JSON per run under 0o700 runs dir; prompts never stored) +
`--run-id/--resume` on `tokenmax` and `recipe run`; fan_out/run_panel
record incrementally; resume replays the ORIGINAL target set (a first
cut re-selected 256 models on resume — fixed to resume_plan, with a
regression test). Transcripts: (1) g21kill hit real outages (1/6
answered) → resume ran only the 5 missing: 2 transient failures
recovered fresh, 1 replayed, 3 dead routes honestly still dead;
(2) g21kill3 SIGKILLed mid-run at 14/40 → resume completed to 40/40
fully resolved; (3) panel recipe g21recipe resumed with
`(4667ms, replayed)` rendering. Quota test asserts replays make zero
live calls. Full suite 2582 passed, coverage gate 87.12%/77.73%, ruff
+ mypy (touched) + check_docs green. Lesson recorded: the 256-model
resume bug burned real daily quotas before the fix — bench was
degraded for later runs (since recovered).

Effort: M–L. Fit: medium-high — completes the G7 story at run level.

## G22 — Agent-loop cache (Status: complete 2026-09-19)

Pain: agentic loops resend the same growing prefix every turn,
burning free quotas 2–5x faster than needed; prompt caching (up to
90% savings where supported) is the industry's #1 mitigation and we
only cache whole responses.

Bet: prefix-aware caching for multi-turn agent traffic stretches
free quotas dramatically with zero behavior change on a hit.

Execute:
1. Prefix-aware cache: hash the stable prompt prefix, serve/cache
   per-turn deltas; exact-hit returns byte-identical behavior.
2. Quota math stays honest: cached prefixes cost nothing, deltas
   cost normally; stats expose hit rate + tokens avoided.
3. Live measurement: same agentic loop with/without the cache,
   quota spend pasted.

Done when:
- [x] Before/after quota spend shows large savings on a realistic
      multi-turn loop with identical outputs (numbers pasted).
- [x] Full suite + gates pass.
- [x] Commit + push; chain complete — report the series result.

Result: prefix-hash routing memory + provider-confirmed cache harvest
(`src/freellmpool/prefixcache.py`, `Reply.cached_prompt_tokens`,
`ManagedPool._actual_cost` deduction, stats/CLI/MCP/proxy surfaces,
`docs/PREFIX_CACHE.md`, `tests/test_prefixcache.py` 23 tests incl. a
rotation regression test). Live 5-turn loop on mistral/codestral-latest:
busted-prefix leg net 3,958 tokens vs stable-prefix leg net 830 (−79.0%),
RESULT verdicts byte-identical 5/5, full text 3/5 with model-side jitter
proven cache-independent. Full suite 2605 passed; ruff clean; mypy zero
new; check_docs green; coverage 87.16/77.86.

Effort: M. Fit: medium — quota multiplier for every agent user.

## Chain G15–G22 series report (2026-09-19)

All 8 goals shipped, each with live transcripts, regression tests, and
green gates: G15 Claude Code $0 mode, G16 privacy routing + redaction,
G17 MCP diet as a weapon, G18 live free-tier status page, G19
security-hardening sprint, G20 free-embedding leaderboard, G21 run
survivor (resume), G22 agent-loop prefix cache. No further goal:
the chain is complete.

## G23 — Round-2 adversarial findings verify-and-fix (Status: complete 2026-09-20)

Pain: second adversarial sweep (8 fresh lenses) found 43 issues; 5 HIGH
(RAG symlink escape → local-file exfil to providers; unguarded
float(cooldown/cache_ttl/catalog-age) crashes + nonfinite values;
batch-aborting failure persistence) plus consequential MEDIUMs around
exactly-once resume, auth/redirect key leakage, secret-safe reports,
orphaned children, bounded buffers, corrupt state.

Bet: verifying every finding against code/behavior and fixing the real
ones with regression tests measurably hardens the free-gateway promise.

Execute:
1. Independently reproduce + fix the 5 HIGHs (TDD, regression tests).
2. Fix consequential MEDIUMs (resume/auth/secrets/orphans/bounds/corrupt).
3. Fresh concrete lifecycle audit (round-2 lifecycle lens was unusable).
4. Full suite + gates green, commit.

Done when:
- [x] All 5 HIGHs reproduced and fixed with regression tests (evidence pasted).
- [x] Consequential MEDIUMs fixed or documented with reason.
- [x] Fresh lifecycle audit complete with concrete findings or clean bill.
- [x] Full suite + gates pass; commit pushed.

Closeout 2026-09-20: all five HIGHs fixed TDD red-then-green —
RAG symlink-escape race (fd-pinned single-read traversal, supervisor
repro now passes: swap_performed=true, outside_fixture_reached_embed=false),
symlink-to-FIFO hang (O_NONBLOCK opens + fstat, bounded subprocess test),
eager scandir defeating MAX_SCAN_ENTRIES (bounded consume-before-sort with
truthful truncation, iterator-consumption test), proxy OverflowError on
nonfinite sample values (sampling validator), and batch-aborting failure
persistence. Consequential MEDIUMs/LOWs fixed with regressions in
tests/test_round2_low.py. Fresh lifecycle audit: 6 concrete findings, all
fixed with lifecycle tests. Gates observed green on final tree: full pytest
suite, ruff check, mypy --strict (both CI invocations), scripts/check_docs.py,
coverage 87.15% line / 78.31% branch (floors 80/70).

Effort: L. Fit: high — reliability/security of the free-tier promise.

## Goal chain G24–G25 (accepted 2026-09-20)

Two consumer-trust goals, sequenced from the G23 closeout mandate:
first-use must stay trustworthy when real free capacity is missing or
changes. Execute strictly in order; each goal's Done-when is the audit
for "did we completely solve this pain?" — including a
clean-environment demonstration, not just unit tests. On completing
G24, immediately create G25 as the active session goal in the same
turn and continue automatically. If a goal is truly blocked, record
the blocker here and continue with the next useful review/goal — never
hold the night hostage. Standing constraints: free-only (no account
creation, purchases, quota circumvention, or paid inference), TDD
regressions, fixture-labeled vs live-labeled evidence, secret-safe
diagnostics, explicit unknown capacity, metaswarm design/plan/coverage
gates, at most two live review/implement children, no nested fanout.

## G24 — Trustworthy first use with missing/changing free capacity (Status: complete 2026-09-20)

Pain: a fresh consumer following the one-command README path may hit
keyless unavailable/slow, all reviewed allowances exhausted or
unknown, an invalid/revoked key, interrupted setup, or provider/model
drift — and get a hanging loop, a misleading free promise, leaked
secrets, or a paid fallback instead of an actionable next step.

Bet: a bounded fresh-consumer audit in an isolated empty HOME, ranked
against current upstream primary evidence for free-route
availability, surfaces the highest-impact remaining end-to-end pain;
fixing that one pain with a defined consumer contract and observable
DoD measurably hardens first use.

Execute:
1. Bounded fresh-consumer audit: README one-command path and
   setup/resume/client handoff in an isolated empty HOME; exercise
   keyless unavailable/slow, exhausted/unknown allowances,
   invalid/revoked key, interrupted setup, provider/model drift.
   Reproduce the highest-impact remaining end-to-end pain first; do
   not reimplement shipped G1/G3/G8/G10.
2. If the paths already work, rank a short next-goal slate from
   recent primary-source/user-problem research and take the strongest
   verified gap.
3. Define the consumer contract + observable DoD; design review gate,
   plan review gate, then implement the first bet with bounded
   children (TDD).
4. Adversarially challenge architecture/code/goal completion; prove
   the fix from a clean environment. Label fake-provider fixture
   evidence separately from live free-route evidence.
5. Full suite + gates green, GOALS.md closeout, commit, push.

Done when:
- [x] Highest-impact remaining first-use pain reproduced end-to-end
  (or slate-ranked gap chosen with primary-source evidence).
- [x] Consumer contract + observable DoD defined and met.
- [x] Fix implemented TDD with regression tests; adversarial review
  passed; clean-environment proof recorded.
- [x] Full suite + gates pass; commit pushed.

Audit result 2026-09-20 (2 bounded workers + parent live repros, all in
isolated empty HOME; primary evidence in /tmp/g24_primary_evidence.md,
slate in /tmp/g24_slate.md):
- R1 FIRST BET: first-run discovery hangs silently on slow/broken
  networks (parent LIVE: blackhole proxy, 45s silence, exit 124;
  worker independently LIVE). No overall deadline (cli.py:3298),
  20s/10s x 16 sequential, ask --timeout starts after discovery.
- R2: cold `status` "complete model discovery needed" never names
  `freellmpool update` (managed.py:272 vs :274). 1-line fix, in scope.
- R3: bogus-key 401 guidance swallowed — CLI prints str(exc),
  ignores client_message with the key var (cli.py:225-227,
  errors.py:43). In scope.
- R4: init wizard never recommends `setup` (init_wizard.py:161-164).
  In scope.
- G25: kilo-403 status→update→status loop (parent LIVE, multi-obs)
  + --resume no-op + resume re-asks skipped. Setup/interrupt/resume/
  handoff otherwise verified working live.

Consumer contract (first bet):
1. First run is loud and bounded: discovery completes (success or
   honest failure) within 60s with progress on stderr, whenever the
   system resolver answers (stalled-resolver delay is a documented
   whole-machine residual; DNS hard bound is G26).
2. Every zero-route/error names the next command.
3. 4xx names provider + key variable, never the secret.
4. No silent paid fallback; no secret echo; unknown capacity explicit.

Observable DoD:
- Blackhole-proxy cold ask exits <60s with progress + connectivity
  cause + next step (not exit 124 silence).
- Refused-proxy cold ask exits fast with an actionable first line
  (the handler's own error may follow; no short-circuit).
- Happy-path cold ask (live keyless) still discovers + replies.
- Cold status names `update`; bogus key names the var (grep-clean);
  init shows setup.
- Fixture slow-provider suite proves deadline/progress/causes/exits
  (red-then-green); full gates green; clean-env proof; pushed.

Effort: L. Fit: high — first-use trust is the free-gateway promise.

Closeout 2026-09-20:
- Gates: design 5/5 PASS (v5+v5.1+v5.2+v5.3, supervisor-006/007
  folded); plan 3/3 PASS (v6+v6.1+v6.2, supervisor-008 folded);
  adversarial review FAIL→folded→green (2 vacuous proofs
  rewritten non-vacuous + 10 minors).
- Shipped (TDD, red-then-green): 40s discovery budget with
  asyncio.wait_for per-page absolute deadline (sync/async twins,
  budget-aware lock, deferred rows, CTO-4 preserve); progress
  order + 3-tier classifier + CSV + summary on all 5 callers;
  deferred ripple (maintenance exempt/deadline-skip, managed
  reason); R2/R3/R4 message fixes (11 sites + 1 genuine 401 path,
  resolved slot names); Dockerfile 90s start-period.
- LIVE evidence (isolated empty HOME, real network unless noted):
  refused-proxy cold ask 0s exit 4 + transport tier; blackhole
  ask 41s + blackhole update 40s, both bounded with progress +
  deferred tier/incomplete footer; keyless cold ask exit 0 in 9s
  with a live reply; bogus OPENROUTER key live 401 naming
  `(check key OPENROUTER_API_KEY)` with the canary absent from
  all transcripts + state; status names update; init shows
  setup first. Transcripts: /tmp/g24_live_*.txt (live-labeled).
- FIXTURE evidence: tests/test_discovery_budget.py (drip/header
  abort with elapsed windows, CTO-4, DNS residual, decoder
  parity, busy lock, EPIPE, schema-1) +
  tests/test_bootstrap_wiring.py (tiers/exits/busy/help/purity/
  canary) + units (auth-hint, slot names, maintenance,
  Dockerfile); 5 pre-existing seam files migrated to _aclient.
- Full suite + ruff + CI strict mypy (22 modules) + check_docs +
  coverage floors (80/70) green.
- Residuals → G25: kilo-403 loop, --resume no-op, resume
  re-asks, proxy str(exc) fallback now carries key-var names
  (names-only, CTO-8 noted), busy+renew-evidence prints a skip
  note, check_provider is unbounded by design (wizard-only),
  public-sources reads are idle-8s (drip-unbounded). → G26: DNS
  hard bound (system-resolver shutdown lag characterized, not
  bounded).

## G25 — Runner-up consumer-trust gap (Status: complete 2026-09-20)

Pain: kilo-403 status→update→status loop (parent LIVE, multi-obs)
from the G24 slate, plus --resume no-op and resume re-asking
skipped providers. Setup/interrupt/resume/handoff otherwise
verified working live in G24.

Bet: closing the kilo-403 loop (verdict + fallback candidates)
with the same contract–DoD–proof discipline compounds
first-use trust.

Execute: reproduce the kilo loop live; define verdict semantics
+ fallback-candidate contract + observable DoD; design/plan
gates; TDD implement with adversarial review; prove from a
clean environment; gates green; commit/push. Same gates and
evidence rules as G24.

Done when:
- [x] Kilo-403 loop + resume gaps reproduced live in isolated
  empty HOME (curl 200/462KB vs httpx persistent 403
  x-vercel-mitigated; skip llm7 + quit re-prompts; --resume
  store_true default True is a no-op).
- [x] Verdict semantics (blocked vs auth_failed, 4-rule K1) +
  fallback-candidate contract (reviewed names shown, never
  served) + observable DoD defined; design gate 5/5 PASS
  (v2+v2.1+v2.2+v2.3+word3), plan gate 3/3 PASS (v1+v1.1+v1.2).
- [x] Implemented TDD (33 tests: U1 classifier 10, U2 ripple 11,
  U3 fallback 5, U4 resume 7); adversarially reviewed
  (TTL-overflow hardening, S4/F7 slash conflict resolved for
  F7, merge/branch simplifications); proven live from clean
  env (update --provider kilo -> blocked N1 + fallback line +
  F footer; status -> R reason; repeat identical; zero
  auth_failed in live state).
- [x] Full suite green, ruff/mypy-strict/docs/coverage gates
  green (2 ruff UP031s pre-existing at base, untouched);
  commit pushed.

Effort: M. Fit: high — compounds G24.

## G26 — DNS hard bound + drip-bounded source reads (Status: complete 2026-09-20)

Pain: stalled system-resolver delay is a documented whole-machine
residual (shutdown lag characterized, not bounded); public-sources
reads are idle-8s but drip-unbounded. A hostile/slow network can
still wedge first use past its loud bounded promise.

Bet: bounding resolver shutdown lag and drip reads closes the
last known unbounded wait in the fresh-consumer path.

Execute: reproduce stall/drip live with bounded harnesses;
define bound semantics + observable DoD; design/plan gates;
TDD implement with adversarial review; prove from a clean
environment; gates green; commit/push. Same gates and
evidence rules as G24/G25.

Done when:
- [x] Stall/drip reproduced live in isolated empty HOME
  (blackhole-DNS netns refresh: fetch ~5s, return lagged to
  glibc ~30s; localhost TLS 1B/7s drip read with no bound).
- [x] Bound semantics + observable DoD defined; design gate
  5/5 PASS (v2+v3+v3.1), plan gate 3/3 PASS (v1+v1.1).
- [x] Implemented TDD (U1 drip helper + ReadDeadlineExceeded 6
  incl. chunk-granularity; U2 five-site wiring + mappings 9;
  U3 daemon executor + _run_sync + wizard bound 19 + 2 guards;
  v5.2 residual test rewritten to the closure contract).
  Adversarial review GO (drop atomicity, forced TPE base,
  teardown order, mappings, ceiling numerals, test honesty all
  PASS; uv.lock collateral reverted, DNS margin widened to
  10s/<6.5 and looped 5x pre-commit).
- [x] Proven live from clean environment (empty HOME; netns
  for DNS): refresh fetch 5.2s + exit lag 0.1s (old code:
  fetch 30.4s); drip single-URL error at 35.0s over 6 real
  bytes. Transcripts /tmp/g26_dns_proof.txt,
  /tmp/g26_drip_proof.txt (scratch, not shipped). G24 cold-ask
  regressions green (refused, blackhole, happy-path).
- [x] Full suite (CI warning flags) + ruff + strict mypy (CI
  module list) + docs + coverage gates green (87.7% lines /
  78.9% branches); 2 ruff UP031s fixed mechanically
  (test-only %-format; G25 predates the newer ruff flag);
  commit pushed.

Honesty claim: this closure covers sync deadline-set refresh
exit + per-read totals + wizard 60s ONLY. Enumerated residuals:
(1) arefresh(deadline=None) fetch-unbounded (G27-candidate
"arefresh deadline wiring"); (2) sync per-source glibc OS time
(no code bound; OS-bounded return asserted by harness);
(3) trust_env proxy variance (out of scope; harnesses clear
proxy env). Inference streams are out of scope for this goal.
LOCK_EX second-writer waits stay a qualitative bound (no numeric
claim), modulo glibc residual.

Implementation findings: ThreadPoolExecutor base forced by the
set_default_executor isinstance gate (no super().__init__, so no
registration); KI re-drive guarded by task.done() (re-driving a
KI-completed future idles in select() per issue #22429); the
sync reader uses iter_raw() passthrough because 64KB chunk
assembly would buffer a slow drip past the deadline.

Follow-up: G27-candidate arefresh deadline wiring (server
callers must pass `deadline` until then; see the
arefresh_catalog docstring).

Effort: M. Fit: high — completes the G24 boundedness promise.

## G27 — bounded async discovery (Status: complete 2026-09-20)

Pain: `arefresh_catalog` without `deadline` was fetch-unbounded;
in-loop server/notebook callers could hang forever with no failure
row and no recovery signal.

Bet: carrying the sync default-budget policy into the async entry
point gives bounded failure/recovery to every caller, including
ones that omit the bound.

Execute: small design + adversarial review (GO-WITH-CHANGES, all
folded); TDD implement (red-first); actual-transport loopback proof
for repeat/cancel/retry; gates green; commit/push.

Done when:
- [x] Default policy carried over: omit both params ->
  `now + budget_seconds(env)` (40s unless env-tuned); stricter
  caller `deadline`/`time_budget_seconds` wins via min(); strict
  finite validation (ValueError on NaN/inf/non-numeric/bool);
  past/zero/negative fast-defer-all (stated, pinned).
- [x] No implicit unbounded mode (review-blessed; big budgets cover
  backfill); timeout degrades to deferred rows over preserved
  last-good with progress intact.
- [x] Cancellation proven safe: entry-gated cancel surfaces
  CancelledError with byte-identical destination and an
  immediately re-acquirable gate; second writer gets DiscoveryBusy
  (small-budget probe documented) and retry succeeds.
- [x] Loop/executor non-interference pinned (same open loop, same
  default executor, no daemon-pool use, dispatch still works);
  bounds explicitly RETURN bounds, shutdown belongs to the caller.
- [x] 27 API-level tests green incl. actual-TLS-loopback
  repeat/cancel/retry with controlled resolver delay; full suite
  (CI flags) + ruff + strict mypy + docs + coverage green; pushed.

Honesty residuals (unchanged from G26, restated): glibc per-source
OS time unbounded by code; trust_env proxy variance out of scope;
LOCK_EX waits qualitative modulo glibc residual; inference streams
out of scope; whole-process shutdown guarantees disclaimed for
caller-owned loops.

Effort: S. Fit: high — closes the last G26-listed residual.

## G28 — unknown-model pins fail loudly with recovery (Status: complete 2026-09-20)

Pain: a removed/typo'd `--model` pin reported "all providers exhausted"
or "no providers configured" — the opposite of the truth when hundreds of
routes are ready — with no next step. Paid/discovery-only pins risked the
same misdiagnosis in the other direction (404 for a model that exists).

Bet: classify the pin against the SAME generation admission uses, so
unknown names 404 with `models`/`update` pointers while known-but-unserved
pins (paid, discovery-only, off-by-default, provider-excluded,
feature-missed) keep the generic guidance.

Execute: small design + adversarial review (R1-R8, all folded); TDD
implement (red-first); supervisor counterexamples reproduced and closed
with their own probes (015 discovery-only pin → 403, independently
re-verified by root); independent tree review (SHIP) with M1/m1/n4 folded
pre-commit; transport-leak root-caused to third-party httpcore with a
pinned regression; gates green; commit/push.

Done when:
- [x] `UnknownModel` (an `AllProvidersExhausted` subclass, 404 + pin +
  `models`/`update` pointers, sanitized/truncated) raised on chat, stream,
  aio, proxy (buffered/streaming/Anthropic → HTTP 404), CLI (tail + rc 4),
  legacy `rank_targets`, and legacy embed/transcribe; pseudo-models exempt
  everywhere; true-empty pools keep the generic errors.
- [x] Identity binds to admission's own generation: managed
  `Snapshot.known_models` (discovery generation + explicit providers, no
  reloaded catalog deciding after snapshotting); router binds to the
  constructor target index. Discovery-only paid pin → generic 403 (015
  probe 4/4 green here and by root rerun); genuinely-absent pin → 404.
- [x] Held-open TLS regression strengthened: cancel stimulus is
  deterministic body-phase (server-side entered-event proof the client
  finished TLS+connect — the old blind sleep hit the upstream window
  racily), plus `gc.collect()` localization so strays surface in their own
  test; adjacency re-verified 63/63 strict-green (was unraisable-red).
- [x] Cancel-during-TLS-connect abandonment root-caused in installed
  httpcore 1.0.9 (`_connect` catches only ConnectError/ConnectTimeout; the
  half-open stream is a frame local; the pool drops the failed connection
  unclosed and `pool.aclose()` reports OK) and PINNED, not hidden: the pin
  test deterministically reproduces the window (held 5s server handshake,
  SYN proven in backlog, cancel pre-request), asserts the exact 2-event
  signature with per-run phase proof, prints every captured event, fails
  loudly on httpcore upgrade (re-probe) and on signature absence (remove
  the pin upstream-fix tripwire). Mutation-checked both directions.
- [x] 33 UnknownModel tests + pin + hold-open regressions green; full
  strict suite 2962 passed + ruff + strict mypy + docs + coverage
  (87.76%/79.01%) green; pushed.

Honesty residuals: m2 edge kept — managed non-chat pin miss with zero
admitted routes for that modality stays generic 403 (can't distinguish
unknown from unconfigured modality); legacy embed/transcribe classify
against their own modality index (a chat-model pin on embed 404s; the
pointers recover); n1 (no pickle round-trip, pre-existing shape), n2
(sanitizer keeps bidi controls), n3 (direct `providers=["p"]` +
`model="p/m"` doubles the prefix) deferred as cosmetic; cross-modality
pins differ legacy-vs-managed (noted, pointers recover). G26/G27 residuals
restated unchanged.

Effort: M (two supervisor counterexamples + third-party root-cause).
Fit: high — every typo'd pin now teaches the fix.

## G29 — per-slot key validation + honest denied verdict (Status: complete 2026-09-20)

Pain: no way to validate WHICH saved key works — `status` shows
routes, the wizard checks one provider at a time interactively, and
an authenticated 403 (scoped key, unverified account) was labeled
`auth_failed`: a usable credential pronounced dead with a
replace-key order.

Bet: a non-interactive `keys check` over the GET-only listing path
gives one evidence-graded verdict row per configured slot, and splits
authenticated-403 into `denied` (inconclusive, scope-first fix) in
every consumer.

Execute: design + adversarial review; TDD implement (red-first);
supervisor counterexample 018 reproduced end-to-end and closed (root
re-verified fixed: 200→ok, 401→auth_failed, 403-scope→
denied/inconclusive, rc0, no replace-key); 019 consumer-wide
consistency sweep (update trailer, wizard text, Cloudflare
account-id hints, quota-claim qualification); gates green;
commit/push.

Done when:
- [x] `keys check` validates every configured slot of every checkable
  provider (Cloudflare, Cohere, Gemini, Groq, Mistral, Zhipu) with
  read-only listing calls: no inference, no rotation-cursor writes,
  no snapshots; local usage ledger provably unchanged (ledger
  logical-equality test); listing metering honestly disclaimed as
  provider policy, not a universal no-quota promise.
- [x] Verdicts grade evidence: `ok` (accepted), `auth_failed` (401
  on single-credential providers — proven dead, replace-key fix),
  `denied` (authenticated 403, any other 403 via the choke-point
  guard, or Cloudflare 401 joint-auth ambiguity — inconclusive,
  scope/account fix, never replace-key), `missing`/`unsupported`
  uncheckable, plus
  `rate_limited`/`blocked`/`partial`/`deferred`/`timeout`/`error`/
  `config_error`; exit 0/1/2 + `--strict` fail-closed; `--json`
  envelope pure (progress on stderr); summary buckets partition
  rows (loud assert); exception notes value-redacted.
- [x] 018 denied split consistent in every consumer: discovery
  `_classify_denied` (authenticated 403 → denied, keyless/mitigated
  stay blocked, 401 stays auth_failed); managed reasons; setup
  wizard breaks without replace-key offer; maintenance `denied`
  status + catalog_failed finding; shared blocked bootstrap tier;
  update footer scope-first trailers (019); onboarding auth_failed
  text authentication-only + Cloudflare account-id hints in wizard
  and keys-check rows (019).
- [x] Zero-network proof for uncheckable providers (call counting),
  checkable-set tripwire, canary secrecy, slot-1 logical equality
  with check_provider, suffix-gap/blank-slot/config.toml coverage;
  full strict suite green (3114 collected, rc0) + ruff + strict mypy
  + docs + coverage (87.87%/79.28%) green; pushed.

Honesty residuals: "proven dead" is scoped to keys-check rows on
single-credential providers (Cloudflare 401s are denied/inconclusive
— joint token/account-ID auth cannot isolate the bad factor; a
token-verify disambiguation probe is a follow-up, not this goal);
discovery keyless-401s mean "add the credential", never a dead key;
denied shares the blocked bootstrap tier line (row notes precise);
denied discovery rows preserve prior models while fresh (the key may
infer fine — a listing-only refusal must not hide working routes),
so preserved-denied rows serve without a scope warning in `status`
(the managed reason field excludes routes; warning-while-serving
needs a new channel — follow-up); unknown future discovery statuses
stay loud (ValueError → config_error rc1 with the status named);
`--timeout` bounds the run plus one in-flight call (stated).

Effort: M (supervisor counterexample + consumer-wide sweep).
Fit: high — "which key is broken?" becomes one command.

## G30 — opt-in inference canary for uncheckable keys (Status: complete 2026-09-20)

Pain: G29 judged keys for only 6 listing-checkable providers. Keyed
OpenRouter/NVIDIA/Vercel/Aion/ModelScope users got `unsupported` and
discovered dead keys only as confusing 401/429s at inference time.

Bet: an explicit opt-in flag sends ONE tiny single-shot chat
completion per unsupported slot to a registry-pinned free model and
maps the raw HTTP outcome onto the same evidence-graded verdicts —
only a clean 401 proves dead.

Execute: design + 3-reviewer plan gate (v1 FAIL-fixable on all three;
v2 + v2.1 folds verified, final PASS); TDD implement (red-first,
MockTransport/fake-POST offline); adversarial review of the diff;
gates green; commit/push.

Done when:
- [x] `--canary` judges the 5 eligible providers (OpenRouter, NVIDIA,
  Vercel, Aion, ModelScope) with one POST each (max_tokens=16,
  thinking floor off, max_attempts=1, 20s bound, per-slot key);
  listing-checkable providers stay GET-only even with the flag.
- [x] Total verdict mapping: 2xx (any text) → ok; 401 → auth_failed;
  403 → denied (mitigated → blocked); 402 → denied; 404/4xx-group/3xx
  → error; 408/504/TimeoutException → deferred; 429 → rate_limited;
  transport → error; overall budget → timeout. No new verdicts.
- [x] Honest spend: flag IS consent (stderr banner, once, only when
  canary steps are planned); attempt-based quota (every dispatched
  attempt records incl. failures; connect-phase records nothing);
  allowance ledger never touched; canary rows carry `via`/
  `canary_model`, listing rows byte-identical.
- [x] Free-only lock: pins match unconditional hard-free grants
  (paid_overage_possible False + no account conditions); Ollama
  excluded (paid-overage grant), llm7 excluded (key-optional),
  credential-less and registry-external stay unsupported.
- [x] 25 canary tests green (tripwire, grant terms, totality, quota
  boundary, single-dispatch bound, secrecy, strict, slots); full
  strict suite green (3139 collected, rc0) + ruff + strict mypy +
  docs + coverage (87.89%/79.32%) green; pushed.

Honesty residuals: canary targets can drift (404 → named drift error,
re-pin); 429 Retry-After deliberately not honored (single-shot, no
sleep); `partial` unreachable for canary rows by design; quota shows
canary spend indistinguishably from real usage (accepted: it IS real
spend); Cloudflare token-verify disambiguation still a follow-up.

Effort: M (plan-gate iterations + total mapping). Fit: high — closes
the G29 coverage gap without weakening any G29 guarantee.

## G41 — honest mid-stream proxy failures (Status: complete 2026-09-22, pushed; full gate rc0 3703 passed)

Pain: post-commit provider `{"error":...}` SSE lines vanished into a generic
502 "stream ended before [DONE]", and all three text-stream handlers emitted
one generic truncation event with no 429-vs-other cause.

Bet: mid-stream error lines surface as status-carrying errors (grounded 429
shapes → 429, else 502 with the provider message), SSE truncation carries a
429-vs-other cause on all three handlers, and mid-stream 429s still never
tick per G33 (see :1988 — that bound stands unamended).

Execute: plan v5 3xPASS (0 MUSTs) → TDD red-first (§5a 10 client tests +
§5b 8 proxy tests, offline fixtures); focused suites + heal pins green;
ruff clean.

## G40 — conflict-quota honesty on launcher+quota surfaces + bench banner count (Status: complete 2026-09-21, pushed; full gate rc0 3678 passed)

Pain: `AllowanceLedger.status()` fail-closed definition-changed rows to
`remaining=0.0` with `definition_status`/`reason`/`retry_after` keys that zero
consumers read — agent-start S1 refused with wrong "wait for reset" guidance
and quota rendered fake `remaining=0`. Separately, `bench -p` announced the
pre-filter provider count.

Bet: S1 names the conflict cause (refusal + partial-conflict WARNING); the
shared quota renderer prints `remaining=CONFLICT` with cause/retry in place;
the bench banner counts the stripped post-filter set.

Execute: plan v2 3xPASS (0 MUSTs) → TDD T1-T6 in the 4 existing test files,
per-surface assertions, byte-identical genuine-exhaustion paths.

## G39 — one-command agent start via agent-start (Status: complete 2026-09-21, pushed d6629a9)

Pain: G8's `fp claude` launched on unready proxies, never validated the
model/registry/quota admission, and left proxy lifecycle (status/stop/
pidfile attribution) to folklore.

Bet: `agent-start` stages S0–S7 (POSIX/binary/port/registry/model
validation, read-only managed admission, real tool-verify evidence,
key resolution, probe-then-reuse-or-spawn with child-side pidfiles,
opencode config, seven-line receipt, exec) with rollback on every
spawned-child failure; `proxy --status/--stop` manage the loopback
proxy via pidfile + cmdline verification; the opencode recipe is
single-sourced from the launcher builder.

Execute: plan v3.4 3xPASS (scope/feasibility/completeness, 0 MUSTs) →
TDD 61 pins + 4-case hermetic acceptance green (89 focused +
4 hermetic, incl. gate warning flags) + ruff + mypy-strict clean on
touched modules; existing suites (launcher/cli/bootstrap/profiles/
opencode-packages) green unedited.

Done when:
- [x] S0–S7 + probe/readiness/status/stop/pidfile + builder-backed
  snippet + test-registry seam + guide rewrite + wheel script.
- [x] Focused 89/89 + hermetic 4/4 green (incl. `-W error` warning
  flags); ruff + mypy-strict clean on touched modules.
- [x] Full gate and push completed: `d6629a9` is on main, and the later
  G40/G41 gates and main CI run `36210055982` validate the incorporated work.
  The original waiting-on-lock note is superseded by those completion records.

Honesty residuals: quota conflict wording was corrected by G40;
foreign 503-empty retries to the deadline; union `a/b` config entries
are menu-only (proxy routes aliases); stop's kill-0 reads zombies alive
until reaped; SIGTERM-may-orphan untested (rerun reuses, stop cleans).

Effort: L (61 pins + hermetic + wheel + audit). Fit: high — one
validated command replaces the G8 multi-terminal ritual.

## G38 — MCP provider-filter honesty: validate-first + fail-closed (Status: complete 2026-09-21, pushed; full gate rc0 3492 passed)

Pain: MCP `provider` typos silently listed nothing (`models`) or
no-candidate errors (`ask`); no typo contract on the agent surface.

Bet: `validate_mcp_provider` verdict pairs (`pass`/`error`) at both MCP
call sites. Precedence POOL > EXTRAS > REG canonicalizing to the actual
executable id; case collisions refused as ambiguous; dead registry fails
closed (`provider registry unavailable; cannot validate provider 'X'`)
for unestablished ids while configured ids still pass; live unknowns
keep the verbatim unknown-template. Help promises "unknown or
unverifiable ids return an error" on both tools.

Execute: plan v1 3xFAIL → v2 3xFAIL → v3 0/3 (F1 test-serving) → v4 F1
dropped by proof (snapshot prefixes ⊆ pool.providers) + verdict-pair
shape → v4.1 3xPASS → TDD 41 pins green + full gate rc0 (pre-fix
evidence: lines 88.57%, branches 80.46%) → independent review BLOCKED
(B1 dead-skip vs help, B2 registry case-erasure, B3 dead whitespace) →
ported repair candidate 00a384d (5 files, hashes verified) + 2 minimal
port fixes (A15 explicit user-catalog seam instead of packaged-content
dependence; `known_ids` mypy-strict rename) + 2 doc nits → 73 focused
pins green (incl. empty-HOME determinism proof) + port ship review
2xSHIP (correctness + contract).

Done when:
- [x] Helper + 2 call sites (skip arms deleted) + 2 schema strings +
  diet 1-line completion + checked-in plan + 73 pins (M15/M15b/A15b/A15c/
  H3 new; M5/M11/A5/A15/H1 restated fail-closed).
- [x] Focused 73/73 (normal + empty-HOME) + ruff + mypy-strict
  (managed_cli) + diff-check + docs-check green; adversarial port
  review 2xSHIP; zero chat/transport calls pinned on cannot-validate.
- [x] Full gate and push completed: the byte-identical port `ac3b360` and
  follow-up corrections `1f740d0` are on main. The completion heading records
  3492 passing tests; later main CI run `36210055982` is also green.

Honesty residuals: ambiguity is global (any-key collision fails every
literal — deliberate strictness); extras-collision ask-side covered by
construction (same helper branch + error path); CLI keeps dead-skip
passthrough (MCP-only fail-closed divergence, specified).

Effort: L (4 plan rounds + BLOCK + port). Fit: high — the agent surface
no longer lies about typos, case variants, or registry outages.

## G37 — validate-first literals on the remaining 9 filter surfaces (Status: complete 2026-09-21)

Pain (G36 non-goals): typos exited 0 with misleading inventory text
(models/health/publish/bench/rag-board), exit 3/4 indistinguishable from
unconfigured (ask/conf), or tracebacked exit 1 (rag-ask after a wasted
embed; discovery.main) — publish even wrote docs files for a typo.

Bet: pool-anchored accept-if-known-anywhere (pool ∪ registry ∪ user-catalog
∪ external ∪ plugins; conf/ask add handler-visible configured ids) for the
7 pool surfaces, strict registry for rag-ask + discovery.main. Exit 2 +
keys-check shape, stdout untouched, validation before network/probes/writes/
embed. One shared `_resolve_cli_filter` (deviates v1.4 Q2 namespaces — the
dead-registry seam is `managed_cli.load_registry`); P46 pins the true legacy
empty-pool message (no-key gate precedes filter-mismatch — spec O5 mispredicted);
models/bench validate once + rewrite canonical (superior to per-split guards:
preserves dead-registry skip parity for `-p ""`).

Execute: surface survey (subagent) → plan v1 3xFAIL (zero-churn falsified;
10M+14m; move+plugins+ordering/scope) → v1.1 feas/scope PASS + completeness
FAIL (24 → minors) → v1.2 feas/scope PASS + completeness FAIL (pin precision
O1-O16) → v1.3 + v1.4 micro-deltas → completeness PASS → TDD (42 red + 10
preservation-green) → implement → plan-bug fix (ask configured-widening for
a missed slash test, conf-precedented) → gate → push.

Done when:
- [x] `_cli_extra_ids` + `_pool_known_ids` + `_resolve_cli_filter`; 9 call
  sites with specified ordering/winner rules; 52 pins + 1 intent-preserving
  fixture (`test_mode.py:113` real ids); publish help note; FREE_SETUP line.
- [x] Full strict suite green (3430 collected, rc0) + ruff + strict mypy +
  docs + coverage (lines 88.50%, branches 80.32%) green; adversarial
  review 2xSHIP (correctness direct; contract via BLOCK→fix→clearance);
  pushed.

Honesty residuals: first-run bootstrap network is pre-dispatch (ask-only of
the 9); corrupt-config masks typo (pool-anchored reversal, disclosed);
programmatic non-registry pools exit 2 on strict surfaces (update/discovery/
setup/rag-ask); MCP provider params + slash-model + canary + keys + frozen
onboarding.main stay as dispositioned; benchmark known-filter banner still
counts unfiltered (pre-existing).

Effort: L (9 surfaces + 52 tests). Fit: high — the typo contract is now
consumer-wide; no filter lies, burns budget, or writes files on a typo.

## G36 — provider-literal honesty + setup --stdin (Status: complete 2026-09-21)

Pain (G35 residuals): `update --provider NOSUCH` tracebacked (exit 1);
`verify --provider NOSUCH` misdirected to exit 3 and burned heal runs on thin
benches; `setup --provider NOSUCH` never named the literal; `setup --stdin`
didn't exist while `_hidden_input` prescribed it — dead guidance for piped keys.

Bet: validate-first unknown-literal exit 2 (keys-check shape) in
setup/verify/update; verify universe = registry ∪ user-catalog ∪ external
(acceptance parity, no behavior change for custom ids); `setup --stdin` saves
one piped key privately with TTY refusal (read() echoes) and sanitized errors.

Execute: plan v1 3xFAIL (2 pinned-test contradictions; 25 completeness gaps;
refactor/TTY scope) → v2 scope PASS + feasibility FAIL (A7) + completeness
FAIL (N1-N20) → v3 feas/scope PASS + completeness FAIL (M1-M3, m4-m12) → v3.1
feas/scope PASS + completeness minor-FAIL (n1-n4) → v3.2 3xPASS → TDD
implement (37 red + 3 preservation-green) → gate → push.

Done when:
- [x] `resolve_provider_ids` + `_unknown_provider_error`; validate-first in
  update (canonical feeds refresh/evidence/display), verify (pre-pool-load,
  pre-heal, registry-skip on dead load), run_onboarding (post-registry-load,
  stdout channel); `_cmd_setup_stdin` 7-step short-circuit; drift documented-
  ignore; 36 pins + 2 intent-preserving fixture updates; FREE_SETUP.md +
  setup README lines.
- [x] Full strict suite green (3377 collected, rc0) + ruff + strict mypy +
  docs + coverage (lines 88.29%, branches 80.02%) green; adversarial
  review 2xSHIP (correctness+secrecy, contract); pushed.

Honesty residuals: verbatim literal echo (keys-check parity);
`onboarding.main` frozen (TTY blocking-read echo + conflated message stay,
incl. the clipboard-wrapper path); N12 boundary 2 lines stricter than frozen
(unobservable <16KB); registry-only setup/update universes (documented);
`rag`/`ask`/`bench`/`models`/`conf` provider flags parked.

Effort: M (3-site validation + stdin path + 40 tests). Fit: high — typos stop
tracebacking, misdirecting, and burning recovery budget.

## G35 — heal honesty: no silent 0-probe lockouts (Status: complete 2026-09-21)

Pain (fresh-consumer audit + parent repro): `verify --heal` printed
"0/4 re-verified, 0 probes" with flat rows and no reason, burned a
daily run, armed a 2h cooldown, and silently skipped heal on retry;
cold `status` prescribed `--heal`, which exits 3 with "run update".

Bet: thrown probes count as attempted with a likely-cause
parenthetical; zero-contact runs are recorded but exempt from
budget/cooldown; every skipped gate announces itself; cold
prescriptions name update/setup; exit 3 documented.

Execute: plan v1 3xFAIL (blanket exemption defeated G31 pacing;
filtered-zero contradiction; matrix/test gaps) → v2 2xFAIL →
v3 2PASS/1FAIL (pin enumeration) → v4 3xPASS → TDD implement →
adversarial review → gate → push.

Done when:
- [x] Attempt accounting + likely-cause parenthetical; no-contact
  exemption (attempted==0 only); attempted>0 keeps full pacing
  (regression-pinned); gate skips announce; executor retains on
  no-contact; `chat_routes` key; cold prescriptions; exit legend.
- [x] Full strict suite green (3337 collected, rc0) + ruff +
  strict mypy + docs + coverage (lines 88.23%, branches 79.87%)
  green; adversarial review SHIP; pushed.

Honesty residuals: cause is best-effort over recorded classes
(`likely` qualifier; bare mechanic fallbacks); wallbox/stale
no-contact retries at daemon cadence (transient, zero upstream
cost; capped-no-contact consumes instead — review caught the
frozen-budget loop); TOCTOU single-emit possible (accurate,
untested); features=() direct-API runs read vacuous-ok (guarded
from no-contact, CLI can't construct); `--provider PROVIDER`
literal + setup `--stdin` parked for G36.

Review: first verdict BLOCK (missing verify-path composition
pins — added; capped retain loop — split to capped-consumes;
features=() hole — probed guard; exempt-save pin rewritten to
the shared tail) + 2 acknowledged notes (mixed-run attribution
as designed; lease-acquisition shape already covered).

Effort: M (accounting + emits + prescriptions + 37 tests). Fit:
high — the tool's own recovery stops lying and locking out.

## G34 — warning-while-serving for preserved rows (Status: complete 2026-09-21)

Pain: a provider whose listing comes back adverse keeps serving
last-good routes while fresh — correct — but `status`/`providers`
render it as plain `ready` with no hint. G29 deferred the warning
channel; G30/G32/G33 took the siblings, this is the last one.

Bet: serving + adverse verdict ⇒ managed row carries a one-line
warning (verdict + preserved count + fix command); admission
untouched; `status`/`providers`/`quota` render it, `--json` and
proxy `/status` carry it machine-readably.

Execute: grounding + plan v1 (completeness FAIL: undecided
consumers, matrix holes) → v2 folds quota/MCP surfacing, /status
flow-through pin, models/readiness lock-ins, full matrix → plan
gate 3xPASS → TDD implement → adversarial review → gate → push.

Done when:
- [x] Matrix: every servable adverse verdict warns (denied,
  auth_failed, auth_missing, unsupported, error, partial,
  rate_limited, deferred+previous-complete, unknown-future);
  ok/excluded rows silent with `warning` present-but-"".
- [x] Renders: status/providers/quota text goldens, `status --json`
  key, proxy `/status` flow-through; models + readiness lock-ins;
  admission identity (route sets byte-identical).
- [x] Full strict suite green (3300 collected, rc0) + ruff +
  strict mypy + docs + coverage (lines 88.16% ≥ 80%, branches
  79.75% ≥ 70%) green; adversarial review SHIP (5 NITs closed +
  G33 tick race fixed); pushed.

Honesty residuals: warning is last-verdict based (clears on next
successful update; status never probes); wording claims preserved/
last-listing, never dead; generation values rotate once on upgrade
(intra-run identity only); models/readiness deliberately unwarned
(catalog vs health split, locked by tests); sanitized pid in the fix
command can mismatch on non-slug ids (real ids are safe).

Also closed: G33 handler tick race found by the G34 review drift
check — `_exhausted` recorded after `send`, so a fast client could
flush before the tick landed (messages-429 test flaked 1/4). Ticks
now record before the response: an observed 429 implies counted.

Effort: S (one row key + three renders + matrix tests). Fit: high —
silent scope cuts become visible where operators already look.

## G33 — proxy demand-driven heal (Status: complete 2026-09-21)

Pain: agent sessions 429-spiral against the proxy while the tool bench
sits collapsed; recovery needs a human to run `verify --heal`. G31
covers verify/status/timers — the proxy path where the pain is felt
records no demand signal and heals nothing.

Bet: terminal tools-429s record demand ticks (memory-only, off the hot
path); an AUTOHEAL-gated out-of-band executor heals when demand
passes threshold, honoring restart-persisted ticks within seconds of
proxy start with zero bind delay.

Execute: grounding survey + spike + 3-reviewer plan gate (v1 FAIL on
all three axes → v2 folds contradictions, merge/executor lifecycle,
consent/minimality); TDD implement in isolated worktree (red-first,
offline); adversarial review; gates green; commit/push.

Done when:
- [x] Ticks only on terminal tools-429 (`had_tools` threaded to all
  `_exhausted` sites; mid-stream out of scope, ≤2/request bound);
  AUTOHEAL-gated recording; retry_after ignored by design;
  account-quota not excluded (backoff containment, disclosed).
- [x] TickStore: aligned 600 s windows, threshold 5, flush-as-move,
  lossless same-window merge, expiry on rollover, torn/silent-safe;
  executor: iteration-0 + anchored 60 s, read-only pre-checks,
  consume-unless-busy, BaseException-proof, idempotent start,
  legacy-pool None gate, tailnet parity.
- [x] Startup ordering: executor after pool, before serve_forever, no
  synchronous heal; two-process tick-loss test; request-path purity
  (record writes no files); docs + G31 "only" amendment with
  starvation disclosure.
- [x] Full strict suite green (3273 collected, rc0) + ruff + strict
  mypy + docs + coverage (lines 88.11% ≥ 80%, branches 79.68% ≥ 70%)
  green; adversarial review SHIP (5 SHOULDs + NITs all closed);
  pushed.

020 closure (independent frozen-source probes, repro
free-g33-concurrency-6308bb9f): demand/flush double-count → seqlock
exactly-once demand (no disk on record path); cross-window failed-flush
migration → restore-only-to-matching-live-bucket; catch-up stacking →
skip-not-stack anchors. Ported as `test_020_*` with corrected
expectations; Daybreak interleavings re-verified against repaired
source (positive control unchanged).

Honesty residuals: account-outage burn (decaying trickle via
low-yield backoff); crash loses ≤60 s of ticks; consume wipes ≤ run
duration of mid-run ticks; mid-stream 429s don't tick; constants are
judgment calls pinned by tests. 021 acceptance limit: a move in flight
past the 50 ms spin budget reads conservative no-demand for one pass
(delay, not loss); overlapping multi-process runs may drop same-window
peer demand on consume (bounded, self-healing).

Effort: M (tick store + executor + proxy threading). Fit: high —
self-restoring proxy during 429 spirals, zero incantation.

## G32 — Cloudflare token-verify disambiguation (Status: complete 2026-09-21)

Pain: every Cloudflare 401 was inconclusive `denied` — a dead token, a
wrong account ID, and a scope problem all looked identical, and scripts
could not fail on a dead CF key (rc0).

Bet: two verify probes (account endpoint, then user endpoint on A-401)
turn H1's shrug into three actionable outcomes on both `keys check`
and the setup wizard, failing closed to H1 whenever the probes cannot
establish a fact.

Execute: spike + 3-reviewer plan gate (v1 FAIL on all three axes →
v2 answers placement/deadline/matrix/exit-code → v2.1 folds re-review:
fresh client, URL-parsed account ID, token-hash memo, M2 gating,
never-raises, wrong-account residual); TDD implement (red-first,
counting MockTransport offline); adversarial review; gates green;
commit/push.

Done when:
- [x] Probes run only on the CF-401 branch with an explicit cache
  (7-function `cf_probe_cache` threading; None = legacy H1, zero new
  I/O); mapper stays pure (outcome token param); `_classify_denied`
  untouched; wizard shares the producer (full parity, no divergence).
- [x] Outcomes: `pair_ok`→denied+scope (wizard: no replace-key offer),
  `wrong_account`→config_error, `token_dead`/`token_expired`→auth_failed
  (both-agree caveat pinned), `inconclusive`/`inconclusive_retry`→H1
  denied; unknown tokens/signals fail closed; probes never raise.
- [x] Bounds: shared remaining `_WIZARD_CHECK_SECONDS` deadline
  (`_MIN_PROBE_SECONDS` floor, per-probe clock reads), ≤2 RTTs on the
  401 path only, per-invocation token-hash memo (values never in keys).
- [x] Honesty: dead-CF-key runs exit 1 (intended change from rc0);
  ACCOUNTS.md H1/exit-code sections rewritten with residual disclosures;
  static notes only (no token/account/URL/exception text); no new JSON
  keys; ledger logical-equality extended to probe runs.
- [x] 40+ verify tests green (42 in test_cf_verify.py: matrix, dedup,
  deadline, refresh chain, redaction, never-raises; T7 wizard rows,
  T8 exit codes, T9 ledger); full strict suite green (3222
  collected/passed, rc0, /tmp/g32_gate_run2.log) + ruff + strict mypy
  + docs + coverage (lines 88.01% >= 80%, branches 79.60% >= 70%)
  green; adversarial review SHIP (6/6 fixes confirmed); pushed.

Honesty residuals: dual-401 is "both verifiers agree" (a token type
neither endpoint accepts would fool both — note says so); B-ok+A-401
can also be a valid token without account access (note leads with the
common wrong-account-ID case, discloses the residual); probes add ≤2
RTTs per distinct (token, account) on the 401 path only.

Effort: M (probe machinery + 7-function threading + wizard parity).
Fit: high — wrong-account-ID is the most common CF setup fault and now
gets an exact fix instead of replace-key guesswork.

## G31 — demand-driven tool-bench heal (Status: complete 2026-09-20)

Pain: tool evidence expires after 7d and the fresh bench collapses
into the G5 429 death spiral; the system only reported it, and
recovery needed obscure verify incantations.

Bet: heal on demand where the user already looks — `verify --heal`
re-probes through the exact verify path, `status` offers without
ever probing, timers heal only under explicit AUTOHEAL opt-in.

Execute: design + 3-reviewer plan gate (v1 FAIL-fixable on
completeness/scope → rescoped v2: proxy-async deferred to G32;
v2.1/v2.2 folds confirmed PASS); TDD implement (red-first, fake
pools/probes offline); adversarial review; gates green; commit/push.

Done when:
- [x] `verify --heal` heals a thin bench (≤4 targets, ≤12 probes/run,
  ≤3 runs + ≤36 probes/day, 1h cooldown doubling to 24h on
  zero-pass/429-heavy runs, reset on restore, wall-box between
  probes); bare `verify` offers only; `status` never probes.
- [x] Consent-explicit: AUTOHEAL=1 enables `verify`/`maintenance
  --refresh`/timer paths only; `=0`/unset disables; explicit `--heal`
  always runs; installer never injects AUTOHEAL.
- [x] Correctness: re-admit at probe time, run lease (threading +
  flock, second runner exits 0), empty selector accounted without
  cooldown, OSError aborts cleanly (exit 1), ledger-denied counted
  as skipped without evidence writes, heal.json history with
  triggers (conformance schema untouched).
- [x] Surface: status offer/cooldown/last-heal/probes-today lines +
  stable JSON keys (`heal_available`, `heal_cooldown_until`,
  `last_heal`, `heal_probes_today`); refresh annotates conformance
  findings with heal outcomes (private reports only).
- [x] 28 heal tests green (triggers, lease incl. threads/processes,
  budget, cooldown, wall-box, selectors, parsing, CLI); full strict
  suite green (3167 collected/passed, rc0, /tmp/g31_gate_run3.log) +
  ruff + strict mypy + docs + coverage (lines 87.93% >= 80%,
  branches 79.43% >= 70%) green; pushed.

Honesty residuals: probes count calls (a tools feature may issue a
followup); per-run cap can stop the 4th target (boundedness wins —
3 passes still restore minimum); quota shows heal spend as ordinary
verify spend; AUTOHEAL timers re-probe on schedule only when thin;
proxy-async demand healing deferred to G33 with reviewer notes (G32
took the Cloudflare-verify slot).

Effort: M (plan-gate rescope + lease/state machinery). Fit: high —
the #1 ranked gap: recovery becomes one obvious command.

## Killed bets (accepted 2026-09-18)

- **#2 Spend budgets + burn alerts** — killed by the free-only corollary:
  no bills exist when everything is free.
- **#3 Maintenance-feed data product** — a second product for a second
  audience; does not make setup easier.
- **#5 Local-LLM overflow bridge** — imports VRAM-tuning complexity, the
  opposite of "just works".

## Shaping decisions (encoded, overridable)

- #1 split: compat hardening yes, cost-attribution smarts no.
- #4: embeddings count as tokens in the vision.
- #9: guide yes, budgets no.
- #8: trust/launch copy executes inside G1 (v1) with the full pass as G6.
